## Rollyourownauth

The project is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, ShadcnUI, and TypeScript. It's main purpose is to showcase how to roll your own authentication system with Next.js. Besides providing comprehensive docs and a full-fledged shadcn-like experience starter kit regarding authentication, which is the MVP, it also contains dozens of features which all are opt-in so you can pick and choose what you need. Built with keeping in mind a SOLID-like architecture with a focus on readability, maintainability, and scalability. Heavy on seperation of concerns.

Most importantly, not depending on external libraries for authentication like NextAuth.js Clerk or Lucia, but instead building your own. Abillity to choose your database, scripts which allow to switch between postgres and sqlite, locally or cloud, dockerized, and more.

## Long term endgoal

A full-fledged authentication system with a focus on security, scalability, and ease of use. Initialized through a CLI which lets you pick any feature you want which then generates the starter, whereas we currently have a feature-flag file meaning that features are turned off, but still in the codebase.

Besides that a auth system with all the bells and whistles. Email & pw, verification, sessions, jwt, social login, passwordless login, rate limiting, admin roles, admin dashboard, custom-rolled non-dependand on library analytics (with admin view), reusable CRUD operations, Queries, SSR and cliet hooks/helpers. Account settings, theming, file uploads, onboarding flow, workspace creation, websockets, CRUD features boilerplates e.g. community blogging for workspaces, and more.
